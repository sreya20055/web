        <p><strong>NASA SPACE APPS '24, MA Engineering College, Kothamangalam, Kerala</strong><br>
        05/10/24 - 06/10/24</p>
        <p>Developed an interactive web application that visualizes exoplanets and nearby stars in 3D space using NASA's Exoplanet Archive and Gaia. Also incorporated the chatbot with real-time Q&A about stellar data in a way to facilitate educational outreach. Developed with Flask, Three.js, and Astroquery for dynamic data retrieval and visualization.</p>

        <h2>AgroScan</h2>
        <p><strong>Arcane Tri-Venue IEEE Hackathon, Kochi, Kerala</strong><br>
        02/11/24 - 03/11/24</p>
        <p>AgroScan is an agro-real-time crop health monitoring system. Using the power of Tiny and IoT, it marks the precise classification of plant diseases. From the capture of crop images using a CNN model deployed on an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense with an OV7675 camera, to through local processing for instant identification of diseases, it is portable, and farmers are empowered by timely data-driven decisions on crop yield and sustainable farming practices.</p>

        <h2>AquaSense</h2>
        <p>AquaSense, A portable, low-cost device for testing water quality connected to a mobile app is developed such that communities can continuously monitor their sources of water and thus reduce the risks of waterborne disease. AquaSense measures pH, turbidity, chlorine, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, temperature, and TDS levels and transmits all the information in real time via Bluetooth to be used for the necessary analysis and reporting immediately. The design with intuitive user experience and the durable, waterproof enclosure allows users to take proactive water safety control in various environments.</p>
